# GT1-html-refactoring-and-accessibility
This repository contains the first homework for the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp where we practiced refactoring existing code and improving the accessibility of html pages.

This goal of this project was to take HTML and CSS code and improve it in two categories. First, the site needed to be more accessible and second, the code needed
to be semantically correct. This involved changing most of the <div> tags to a more appropriate section tag, such as header or main, and adding comments.
